# Project 03: Weather App Using API 🌦️

## Overview

This project is a Weather Application built using Python that fetches real-time weather data using an external API.

Users can enter a city name, and the application returns:

- Temperature
- Weather condition
- Humidity
- Wind speed

## Technologies Used

- Python
- REST API
- API Key Authentication
- JSON Data Handling

## Features

- Real-time weather data retrieval
- Secure API key usage
- Input validation
- Error handling for invalid city names

## How It Works

1. User enters a city name.
2. The application sends a request to the weather API.
3. API responds with JSON data.
4. The program extracts and displays relevant weather details.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding API integration
- Working with HTTP requests in Python
- Handling JSON responses
- Implementing error handling in applications

## Internship Context

This project was completed as part of my Python Development Internship to demonstrate API integration and real-world application building.
