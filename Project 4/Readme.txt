Number Guessing Game with GUI (Tkinter):-

Project Description
This project is a Number Guessing Game developed using Python and Tkinter GUI library as part of my internship tasks.
The application generates a random number between 0 and 10, and the user must guess the correct number within limited attempts. The program provides feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
This project demonstrates GUI development, event handling, conditional logic, and random number generation in Python.
