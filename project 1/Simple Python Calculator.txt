# Simple Python Calculator 🧮

This project is a Simple Calculator application built using Python as part of my Python Development Internship.  
The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of Python basics, logical conditions, and user input handling through a practical, hands-on task.

## 🔹 Project Overview

The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations through a command-line interface (CLI).  
It allows users to enter numbers, select operations, and view results in real time.

This project helped me apply programming concepts in a real-world style task and improve my problem-solving approach.
